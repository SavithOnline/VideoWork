# Manim Animation Scripts Repository

Welcome to my Manim Animation Scripts Repository! This repository serves as a collection of Python scripts created using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), a powerful mathematical animation engine. These scripts are used in my video production work for various YouTube channels, where I create engaging educational and visual content.

## About This Repository

I’m a video content creator passionate about visualizing complex concepts through animations. This repository is a central hub for sharing the Manim scripts I’ve developed for my projects. Whether you're a fellow creator, educator, or animation enthusiast, feel free to explore, use, and adapt these scripts for your own purposes under the terms of the license below.

### Key Features
- **Educational Animations**: Scripts designed to explain mathematical, scientific, and technical concepts.
- **Reusable Code**: Modular and well-commented scripts for easy customization.
- **Real-World Examples**: Animations used in actual YouTube videos across multiple channels.
- **Open Source**: Free to use, modify, and share (see [License](#license)).

## Prerequisites

To run these scripts locally, you’ll need to set up Manim on your machine. Below are the basic requirements:

- **Python 3.7+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Manim**: Install the community edition of Manim. Follow the official [installation guide](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html).
- **Dependencies**: Additional libraries may be required depending on the script (e.g., NumPy for some animations).

### Installation Steps
1. Install Python: [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
